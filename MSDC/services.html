                        <h6>Ultrasonic scalers use ultrasound to remove calculus deposits from your teeth more effectively. They work mechanically using high vibrational energy that effectively blasts calculus, so it is easier to remove. <br> <br>Ultrasonic scalers are more effective and less invasive than manual scrapers. They also allow the hygienist to clean your teeth better, getting into harder to reach areas. Using an ultrasonic scaler may even result in whiter teeth since it's possible for surface stains to be removed in the process.</h6>

                        Root canal treatment is needed when dental X-rays show that the pulp hasbeen damaged by a bacterial infection. <br> <br>

The light used falls under the visible blue light spectrum. <br> <br> Composite resin fillings (also known as white fillings) are a type of filling made of glass or quartz within a resin medium that produces a tooth-colored material.

It can also help to look after the long-term health of your teeth, gums and jaw joints, by spreading the biting pressure over all your teeth. <br> <br> Even adults can need orthodontic treatment. Many orthodontists say kids should see an orthodontist once their permanent teeth start coming in, around age 7. At this age, issues such as uneven bite and overcrowding will become apparent.

                        <h6>Dental implant surgery is a procedure that replaces tooth roots with metal, screwlike posts and replaces damaged or missing teeth with artificial teeth that look and function much like real ones. Dental implant surgery can offer a welcome alternative to dentures or bridgework that doesn't fit well and can offer an option when a lack of natural teeth roots don't allow building denture or bridgework tooth replacements.</h6>

                        <h6>Dental crowns are tooth-shaped “caps” that can be placed over your tooth. Think of it like a snug hat for your tooth. The crown restores the tooth's shape, size, strength and appearance. The dental crown is cemented into place on your tooth and it covers the visible portion of the tooth. <br> <br> Dental crowns serve as a permanent “cap” for your teeth, fully enclosing them with a cover made from ceramic, porcelain, or alloy.</h6>

                        <h6>A dental bridge permanently replaces missing teeth with false teeth. The bridge is attached to the teeth on either side of the gap. Bridges are usually made of porcelain or metal, a mixture of the 2, or zirconia. They are fixed in place. <br> <br>Dentists often recommend bridges instead of dentures if the patient has enough healthy teeth left. The healthy teeth can act as anchors for bridges, as opposed to dentures that must be anchored to the gums using some time of temporary sealant which is not as secure. Bridges are faster than other options.</h6>

                         Gaps left by missing teeth can cause problems with eating and speech, andteeth either side of the gap may grow into the space at an angle. <br> <br>                         
                         Sometimes all the teeth need to be removed and replaced. <br> <br>Dentures may help prevent problems with eating and speech. If you need complete dentures, they may also improve the appearance of your smile and give you confidence.</h6>

                          <h6>Root canal treatment (endodontics) is a dental procedure used to treat infection at the centre of a tooth. Root canal treatment is not painful and can save a tooth that might otherwise have to be removed completely. <br> <br>
                          Root canal treatment is needed when dental X-rays show that the pulp hasbeen damaged by a bacterial infection. <br> <br>
                          The pulp may become inflamed if it's infected by bacteria, allowing thebacteria to multiply and spread.</h6>
